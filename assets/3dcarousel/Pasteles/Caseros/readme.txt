By downloading our Dock Gallery FX you have access to one of the most customizable Flash gallery on the internet. All of our galleries are XML driven, so there is no need to use Adobe Flash to change the gallery's attributes or its assets.
The easiest way to start customizing our product is with its LiveDemo, which has all the gallery's attributes available.
